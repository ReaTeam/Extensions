@about A REAPER extension to emulate digital console type of workflow for setting channelstrip plugin parameters in the context of currently selected track/channel. Registers 32 custom actions which function as kind of API based virtual control surface, or 'dynamic' macro controls similar to Quick Controls in Cubase. 8 endless rotary encoders in MIDI Relative mode and 24 buttons are supported, and in practice required for any reasonable use. 8 buttons are reserved for navigating the 'virtual channelstrip'. Built-in support for some FabFilters, the ReEQ and some stock REAPER plugins. [More information on GitHub](https://github.com/ak5k/reafab)
