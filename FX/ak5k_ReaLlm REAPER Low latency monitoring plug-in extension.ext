  # ReaLlm: REAPER Low latency monitoring plug-in extension

  Cubase/Logic style low latency monitoring mode for REAPER. While enabled, restricts PDC latency ('plugin delay') to one block/buffer size by bypassing plugins from input monitored signalchains. Re-enables plugins once signalchain is no longer input monitored, or ReaLlm is disabled. While ReaLlm is enabled, disabled plugins can be re-enabled manually, and ReaLlm will consider them 'safed' and leave them untouched, unless they're again manually re-disabled. Remembers 'safed' plugins per REAPER project. Leaves already disabled plugins untouched.
