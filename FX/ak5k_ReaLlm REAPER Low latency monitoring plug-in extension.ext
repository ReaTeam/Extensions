@description ReaLlm: REAPER Low latency monitoring plug-in extension
@author ak5k
@version 0.4.0
@changelog
  REAPER v6.72 or later required.
  Disables PDC for monitored signalchain to achieve lower latencies or to allow more processing while monitoring.
  "P_PDCLIMIT" can be set as floating point number, e.g. "0.5" to set target latency of 0.5 times current buffer/block size.

  # ReaLlm: REAPER Low latency monitoring plug-in extension

  Cubase/Logic style low latency monitoring mode for REAPER. While enabled, restricts PDC latency ('plugin delay') to one block/buffer size by bypassing plugins from input monitored signalchains. Re-enables plugins once signalchain is no longer input monitored, or ReaLlm is disabled. While ReaLlm is enabled, disabled plugins can be re-enabled manually, and ReaLlm will consider them 'safed' and leave them untouched, unless they're again manually re-disabled. Remembers 'safed' plugins per REAPER project. Leaves already disabled plugins untouched.
